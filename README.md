## Description

This is a reports API that was created as a pilot application for the [Open-DAI](http://www.open-dai.eu/) platform. Open-DAI is an EU-funded project for opening public data through a common infrastructure.

The API allows access to location based reports from [Karlshamn municipality](http://www.karlshamn.se/) in Sweden. Feel free to fork and modify the application to create something similar with another scope.

### Installation

To build and run this application you need to have node.js. It also requires server access to the Open-DAI platform.

To install simply run:
```
npm install
```

To run the server and start providing the API:
```
node server.js
```
